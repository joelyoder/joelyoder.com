    <h1>Responsive web design since Tripod was tubular</h1>
    <p><strong>👋 Hi, I'm Joel Yoder.</strong> It seems you've stumbled across my website, and since the lack of styling didn't immediately scare you away, give me a few paragraphs to tell you what I'm all about.</p>
    <br />

    <h2>👨‍💻 Me in a few paragraphs</h2>
    <p>I'm a web designer from Terre Haute, Indiana. Despite what you may be assuming from this skeleton site, I actually make and maintain some pretty cool looking stuff. My main gig is Webmaster of <a href="http://www.smwc.edu/">Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College</a>.</p>
    <p>My first website was on the free hosting platform called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod.com">Tripod</a> back in the wild west days of the internet. I've progressed a long way from table layouts, font tags, and animated clipart, but quality HTML and CSS semantics still matter a lot to me.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing video games, geeking out about sci-fi and superheroes, hanging out with our cat <a href="https://i.imgur.com/fBVQEM9.jpg">Lucy</a> 🐱 and rabbit Pippin 🐰, and using too many commas.</p>
    <h3>🛠️ My tools of choice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Code editor: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></li>
        <li>CMS: <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a></li>
        <li>Plain ol' HTML & CSS with some other fancy stuff sprinkled in</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>🏗️ Stuff I've made</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://smwhistoricdistrict.org/">Saint Mary-of-the-Woods Historic District</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://threekeysmusic.com/">threekeysmusic.com</a> (I ❤️ Music Therapy)</li>
        <li><a href="http://citylimitslaundry.com/">citylimitslaundry.com</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>🎮 What I'm playing right now</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.warframe.com/?category=pc">Warframe</a> - If you're a Tenno and want to make my day, message JTtornado and say you found my website. Or just say "CLEM", that works too.</li>
        <li><a href="https://worldoftanks.com/">World of Tanks</a> - Nothing is quite as satisfying as blowing the turret off an enemy tank. Also it doesn't hurt that my wife is killer artillery support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>😤 Ok, seriously, what's with the crappy site?</h2>
    <p>The design for this site was inspired by <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this ever-relevant satire site (beware of swears)</a>. <strong>Honestly, I was tired of feeling guilty for being a web designer without a website.</strong> It's easy to fall down the rabbit hole of a frameworks, templates, and CMS options and forget that websites can just be some HTML on a page. This will likely be replaced with something a little more visually interesting at some point...</p>
